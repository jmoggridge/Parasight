# Parasight
Kmer-based classification of Apicomplexan 18S rRNA genes

The main script - that builds all the classifiers, tests them, and creates all the figures in the submission - is the file '*JMoggridge_Apicomplexa_classifier_notebook.Rmd*' (the .pdf version of the same name is a rendered version of the script + output, embedded within the written sections of the submission)

The submitted paper is '*JMoggridge_parasight_pdf.pdf*', which was rendered from the file '*JMoggridge_parasight_pdf.Rmd*'.
